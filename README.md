## About Brain Tumors

### What is a brain tumor?

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. It can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign), causing an increase in pressure inside the skull and potential brain damage.

### Importance of Early Detection

Early detection and classification of brain tumors are crucial for selecting the most suitable treatment method, ultimately saving lives.

### Methods

This project employs deep learning approaches for brain tumor diagnosis, including detection, location identification, and classification based on malignancy, grade, and type.
